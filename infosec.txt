start participating in ctfs on ctftime(this will boost your problem solving skills)
//
//
solve previous questions of ctf and read writeups

cybersecurity has many branches like:
	1.web security
	2.network security
	3.forensics
	4.binary exploitation
	5.steganography

learn creating ssh public key and connecting to ssh server
