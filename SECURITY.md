# Introduction to Ethical Hacking/Pentesting.

**Follow steps to start:**
1. Install linux in your system.(**Kali Linux** recommended)

2. Learn basic linux commands.

3. Do the basics of programming.```(html/css, js, PHP, sql, python)```

   For basics and in-short watch derek videos.[link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSX7fVd4OUFp_ODd86H0ZIY)

4. Few concepts to be learned:
	+ Methods (mainly get and post)
	+ IP
	+ DNS
	+ Ssh
	+ Telnet
	+ Port

### How does internet work?

* **IP**:  ```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bDA5FK6gs```

* Solve basic ctf problems from [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)

* After completing this, move to [Hack this site](https://www.hackthissite.org/)(basic and js challenges)

* Learn Python as many tools/scripts are made out of it.

* After this move to backdoor sdslads, picoctf previous ctf challenges

* Learn to use github as it is like a  best friend to a hacker

* Learn about owasp top 10 vulnerabilities.


* learn basics of vim and nano

* **Some most used commands:** ```cat, ls, vim, ping, file, find, du, pwd, env, chmod, wget,cron,telnet,gzip,bzip2,tar,base64,grep,nc,curl,strings,whatweb, wildcards and many more.```


* Start participating in ctfs on [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/)(this will boost your problem solving skills.)

* Solve previous questions of CTF and read Writeups.

## Cybersecurity has many branches:
	1. Web security
	2. Network security
	3. Forensics
	4. Application Security
	5. Steganography
	6. Mobile Pentest,...

* Learn creating ssh public key and connecting to ssh server

* Master some most important tools of Kali: 
```Burpsuite,Webscrab, Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark.```

* Learn using some browser extention which will help in solving CTF problems:
```Hackbar,Cookie-editor,Open referer control,...```

* Learn about vulnerabilities: 
```XSS, Htmli, Sqli, Parameter Tampering, Host Header Injection, URL Redirection, LFI, RFI, CCRF, SSRF, Subdomain Takeover, CMDi, XMLI, etc.```
